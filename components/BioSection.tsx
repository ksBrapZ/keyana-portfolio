            <p><strong>My life has always been guided by curiosity - a relentless drive to explore how things work, <em>why they matter</em>, and <em>how they can be improved</em>.</strong></p>

            <p>I was raised between cultures, with an Iranian mother and an American father in London, England. Spending my teens and early twenties traveling widely taught me to appreciate the <em>richness and diversity</em> of people everywhere. In 2021, I moved to America to build the next chapter of my life.</p>

            <p>My multicultural upbringing sparked my fascination with systems—both physical and digital. From software applications to motorcycles, I've always been drawn to understanding the underlying mechanics of things: how they operate, why they fail, and <strong>what makes them last</strong>. As systems grow more complex and skills more specialized, I believe there's profound value in <em>returning to basic principles</em>, connecting deeply with the fundamentals.</p>

            <p>For me, happiness lies in creating intentionally, taking thoughtful risks, and building things that endure. Above all, though, my deepest joy is found in family—my <strong><em>small but growing guiding light</em></strong>.</p>
