# Honnold Isn't Reckless. You Are.

Alex Honnold just climbed Taipei 101 without a rope, and statistically, *it's one of the safest career decisions he's ever made*.

Yesterday morning, Honnold ascended 1,667 feet of steel and glass in ninety-one minutes. No harness. No net. Netflix built in a ten-second broadcast delay - exactly the time his body would take to hit the ground.

Millions watched, expecting transcendence or tragedy. The internet called him deranged, an irresponsible father of two young daughters, a man with a death wish.

The internet is wrong.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks occupational fatality rates per 100,000 workers. Logging: 98.9 deaths per year. Fishing: 86.9. Roofers: 51.8. Truck drivers: 26.8.

Compound that across a career. A logger working 25 years faces a 2.44% lifetime chance of dying on the job. A roofer: 1.29%. These aren't abstractions. These are fathers dying at predictable rates to keep lumber cheap and shingles in place.

Nobody calls roofers deranged. Nobody questions whether a truck driver should have kids.

A roofer earns median $51,000 annually while facing that 51.8 per 100,000 death rate. Over 25 years: roughly $1.27 million lifetime earnings with a 1.29% chance of dying. That works out to about $98,000 per 0.1% of mortality risk.

Honnold's Netflix payment was reportedly mid-six figures. But that's just the direct fee. Factor in the exposure boost to his sponsorships, the speaking engagements he'll book referencing this climb, the documentary residuals; the total economic value of yesterday's ninety minutes is conservatively seven figures.

If his mortality risk was 0.5% (an absurdly high estimate I'll address shortly), he earned $200,000+ per 0.1% of risk. *For one morning.*

The roofer spends 50,000 career hours to achieve a fraction of that return.

The roofer is the one who should be questioned about risk tolerance.

The obvious objection: roofers don't choose hazardous work; they're constrained by circumstance. The risk is imposed, not embraced.

This is incomplete.

Every roofer chooses roofing over alternatives, just as Honnold chooses climbing. The difference isn't agency—it's payoff. Honnold takes visible risk for exceptional compensation.

Roofers take invisible risk for ordinary wages. We've simply decided that diffuse, unglamorous death is acceptable because the work needs doing.

But Honnold's risk wasn't 0.5%. Not even close.

I've climbed for ten years. I lead 5.11s, which makes me competent by gym standards and unremarkable by any serious measure. I've also played enough poker to understand bankroll management viscerally - the difference between sitting down with 10% of your net worth versus 0.1%.

Taipei 101 was compared by climbing media to two classic Yosemite routes stacked together, both graded 5.11c. But that comparison flatters the building. Rock climbing rewards problem-solving - every move is different, every sequence demands adaptation.

Taipei 101 is essentially the same three moves repeated for ninety minutes, with a balcony rest every eight floors. The actual climbing difficulty, accounting for the repetition and recovery opportunities, was probably closer to sustained 5.10d. Maybe easier.

The Yosemite Decimal System runs from 5.0 (walking) to 5.15d (achieved by maybe a dozen humans alive). Honnold's documented maximum is 5.14d. He warms up on 5.12s.

He free soloed El Capitan at 5.13a; a route with a V7 boulder problem crux at 1,700 feet where most climbers need to release all four points of contact to reach the final hold.

Taipei 101, at effective 5.10 with mandatory rest breaks, is what Honnold might climb to loosen up before a real session. Four to five letter grades below his max.

The equivalent of asking a chess grandmaster to beat a club player, or a professional poker player to grind out a win at $1-$2.

When I stepped up from $1-$2 to $2-$5 No Limit, buying in for $1,500 when my bankroll was $10,000 felt suicidal.

Then I watched high-stakes players with $500,000 on the table laughing at bad beats. Same variance. Radically different exposure. They were playing with 2% of their bankroll. I was playing with 15%.

Honnold climbing Taipei 101 is the professional with deep stacks. Thirty years of full-time climbing. Millions of moves. Two and a half months training specifically for this building. Plus balconies every eight floors—if anything felt wrong, he could stop.

This wasn't El Capitan, where retreat itself is death-defying. Taipei 101 was designed for controlled, iterative risk.

El Cap was truly risky.

Freerider contains a crux at 1,700 feet where one foot slip means a 3,000-foot fall onto granite talus. No balconies. No abort points.

Honnold spent eight years thinking about that climb, rehearsed it dozens of times on rope, backed off twice before completing it.

But he was unmarried, childless, and had explicitly framed the risk as worth taking for the accomplishment of a lifetime ambition.

Now he's forty with a wife and two daughters. His response to increased responsibility? He climbed something easier.

Taipei 101 was not El Capitan 2.0. *It was a deliberate regression toward safety* - maximum spectacle from minimum danger.

This is not someone who's lost control. This is someone who has internalized risk-reward so thoroughly he can extract everything the audience wants while exposing himself to almost nothing.

The people calling Honnold irresponsible are operating on vibes, not math.

They see the height and project their own terror. They imagine themselves—untrained, unacclimated—clinging to steel a thousand feet up.

They cannot imagine what it feels like when the skill gap between yourself and the challenge is so vast that the challenge barely registers.

I feel this projection too. Watching Honnold, my hands sweat. My body responds to the visual stimulus of danger even though I know I'm watching someone for whom this is routine.

*But my discomfort is about me, not him*. It reveals my limitations, not his recklessness.

Every year, approximately 400 roofers die in the United States. We don't know their names. We don't clutch pearls about their life choices. We don't ask whether they're being responsible fathers by going to work.

We accept that someone has to replace shingles, some will fall, and that's the cost of functional roofs.

The outrage at Honnold scales inversely with actual risk.

The Netflix audience can't distinguish 5.11c from 5.15d. All they see is a man without a rope on a tall building, and they assume he's insane.

He's not insane. He's skilled. The failure to perceive that distinction says something about us.

Honnold himself: "I like to differentiate between risk and consequence. When I'm free-soloing, I think the risk that I'll fall is quite low, but the consequence is serious."

Consequence severity (death) and probability of occurrence (approaching zero, for him, on this route) are separate variables.

A recreational climber free soloing Taipei 101 would be suicidal. Honnold has low probability and high consequence; acceptable, even prudent, given the compensation.

Meanwhile, a roofer has moderate probability and high consequence, repeated five days a week for decades, for wages that don't approach what Honnold earned yesterday.

The roofer is taking the worse bet. We just don't notice because it's invisible, unspectacular, and essential.

I'm implicated too. I drive a car. I eat processed food. I spend sedentary hours that will probably take more time from my life than anything Honnold has done to his.

*I accept these risks automatically because they're normalized, not because they're small.*

**The things that feel dangerous often aren't. The things that actually kill us often feel fine.**

Honnold ascending a skyscraper is a controlled demonstration of skill that looks terrifying.

Your commute to a job you tolerate is slow-motion death that feels like nothing.

Who's the reckless one?
