*On one level, its the study of the mind as it relates to behaviour.* But if we think about what that means, we'll see that psychology is ultimately concerned with the factors that motivate a person to take a specific action. *It's about the mental states which determine our decision to do anything.*

**So when we ask why studying psychology is useful, we're really asking why understanding human motivation is useful.**

## 3 reasons:

### *1 - Human motivation/behaviour applies to everything*

Psychology is foundational to Economics, Sociology, Psychiatry, Neuroscience, Education, Criminology and many other subjects. Even in your job, whatever it is, psychological principles will apply. **An understanding of human motivation is an understanding of personal wellbeing, relationships, sales, product design, user experience, company culture, strategic planning and so much more.**

*That matters to you, no matter your job.*

### *2 - Understand yourself*

We like to think that we are fully autonomous agents directing all of our thoughts and actions. In reality though, *our behaviour is determined by a complex interplay of experience, emotions and biases.* As the great philosopher David Hume said, **"reason is the slave of the passions"**.

*Psychology allows you to empower reason against the passions.*

### *3 - Understand others*

Once your own motivations are understood, it is possible to extrapolate that understanding to the motivations of others. A strong sense of the many factors which drive behaviour in other people will make you a more effective empathiser and thereby a more effective communicator. **Understanding how others tick will allow you to adjust your communication for maximum effectiveness.**

*Speaking of motivation... ready to dip your toes into the fascinating world of psychology yet?*
