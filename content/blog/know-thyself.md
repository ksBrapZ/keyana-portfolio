Picture a room of ten college graduates.

Four of them would choose a different major if they could rewind the clock.

Nearly half of everyone who went through the system, came out the other side, and thought: I picked wrong.

Now zoom out from majors to careers.

Two-thirds of workers report career regrets. Among millennials, that number hits 70%.

The single most common regret? Not pursuing a passion.

This is a systemic failure rate that would shut down any other industry.

If 44% of surgeries went wrong, we'd close the hospital. If 70% of bridges showed structural failure at midlife, we'd fire every engineer in the country.

But when it comes to the single most consequential decision a young person makes we just shrug and call it "figuring it out."

Nobody in that room lacked information. They had course catalogs, career fairs, aptitude tests, and a $200/hr SAT tutor.

What they lacked was someone whose job it was to help them understand themselves.

## Optimized for Admission, Not for Life

Think about what "guidance" looks like inside the system. A school counselor with 400 students on their caseload. A 20-minute meeting junior year where you pick five colleges based on your GPA band. Maybe a personality quiz that tells you you're an ENFJ, which is approximately as useful as a horoscope.

The entire apparatus is oriented around a single question: what will get you in? Not “what are you drawn to?” Not “what problems make you lose track of time?” Not “where do your strange, specific interests intersect with something the world actually needs?” Just “what's your score, and what university tier does that unlock?”

The SAT tutor is the perfect symbol of the problem. Parents will spend $10,000 to raise a test score by 50 points without blinking. That investment has a clear, measurable return: a better college, a better resume line, a slightly wider on-ramp to the same conveyor belt.

But investing in helping a kid figure out what kind of life would actually fulfill them? There's no line item for that. No ROI spreadsheet. No clear metric. So it doesn't happen.

And then we act surprised when those kids wake up at 30 making $150k only to feel hollow inside.

The "what do you want to be when you grow up?" question is the original sin here. It asks a child to pick a role from a menu before they've even begun to understand their own appetites. It's like asking someone to order dinner when they've never tasted food.

The honest answer for most 17-year-olds is "I have no idea," but the system can't process that input. It needs a declared major by sophomore year. It needs a track. It needs you slotted.

So kids do what smart kids do: they optimize for the system. They pick the major that sounds prestigious, or that their parents approve of, or that the career data says pays well. They perform brilliantly at every gate (grades, internships, first job) and then quietly wonder, years later, why none of it feels like it's truly theirs.

## Aristotle Already Solved This

The education we actually need was described in detail about 2,400 years ago. We just stopped listening.

Aristotle argued that education has one purpose: to help people flourish. Not to help them function. Not to help them earn. To help them flourish—to pursue what he called eudaimonia, a word we clumsily translate as "happiness" but that really means something closer to "living well and doing well" simultaneously.

A life of purpose, competence, and virtue, all working together.

His framework was built on a few common-sense ideas that sound radical against the backdrop of modern education:

First: people have a telos, an inherent nature and purpose. Education's job is to help you discover yours, not to assign one to you.

Second: that discovery is individualized. Aristotle recognized that people have different strengths, different aptitudes, different constitutions. A teacher who treats every student identically has failed before they've started.

Third: education is holistic. Body, character and intellect. Not just intellect. And certainly not just test performance.

Socrates had a word for what a great teacher does: maieutics. Literally, "midwifery."

The idea is that knowledge and self-understanding are already within the student. The teacher's job is to draw them out through questioning, not to pour information in from the outside. The Socratic method isn't a debate technique. It's a philosophy of education built on the premise that the most important things a person needs to know are already latent within them, waiting for the right questions to bring them to the surface.

We didn't lose this wisdom because it was wrong. We lost it because it couldn't be standardized.

You can't scale Socratic midwifery to a classroom of 35. You can't measure eudaimonia on a scantron. You can't build an admissions process around the question "is this student discovering their nature?" So we replaced all of it with something that could be measured, scaled, and administered: content delivery and assessment. Inputs and outputs. Scores.

The ancient world understood something we've forgotten: the most important education isn't learning what to think or even how to think. It's learning who you are. Everything else follows from that.

## Discovery, Intersection, Wonder

So what would it look like if we actually took this seriously?

Imagine a tutor whose job is not to help your child ace a test but to help them uncover a life. Someone who sits with a 14-year-old and instead of asking "have you thought about what you want to major in?" asks: What do you find yourself doing when nobody's making you do anything? What problems bother you enough that you'd work on them for free? What are you good at that you don't even realize is unusual?

This tutor's work would move through three phases.

The first is discovery. Not "career discovery" in the way guidance counselors mean it (here's a list of jobs, pick one). Real discovery: helping a young person identify their intrinsic interests and natural aptitudes. Not what they're "good at" in school (which is often just what they've been rewarded for) but what they're drawn to when nobody's watching, grading, or incentivizing. The kid who spends hours taking apart electronics isn't just "fidgety." The kid who reads about ancient civilizations for fun isn't just "bookish." Those instincts are data.

The second is intersection. Most interesting lives aren't built on a single skill or interest; they're built at the collision point between two or three. The kid who loves biology and storytelling might become a science writer, or a documentary filmmaker, or a public health communicator. The kid who's obsessed with both music and mathematics might find their way into acoustic engineering, or algorithmic composition, or instrument design. A great tutor helps a young person see these intersections before the system forces them into a single lane.

The third is wonder. This might be the most important, and it's the one most completely absent from modern education. Expose kids to the long arc of human thought. Show them that the questions they're wrestling with (What makes a good life? What do I owe other people? How should I spend my limited time?) have been asked by brilliant minds for millennia. Let them encounter Aristotle, the Stoics, the Bhagavad Gita, Montaigne, the Daoist tradition. Not as a humanities requirement to be endured, but as a living conversation they're being invited into. Give them the sense that the world is deep; that beneath the surface of daily life there are layers of meaning, beauty, and inquiry that will never be exhausted.

In a world where AI can perform most cognitive tasks, where technical skills have a half-life measured in months, where entire industries appear and disappear within a decade, the question "what should I study?" is becoming almost meaningless.

But the question "what kind of person should I become?" has never been more urgent. Self-knowledge doesn't depreciate. A sense of purpose doesn't get automated away. The ability to find meaning in your work, to connect what you do with who you are... that is the most durable skill there is.

## What I Want for My Kids

My wife and I are planning to start a family. And when I think about what I want for our kids, it's not "get into a good college." It's not "land a high-paying job." I've done both of those things, and I can tell you firsthand that neither one, on its own, produces the kind of life you're actually proud of.

What I want is for our kids to know themselves. To have had someone in their corner early enough who asked the right questions, helped them see their own strange constellation of interests and abilities and introduced them to the ancient wisdom that makes a life feel coherent rather than accidental.

Thirty-six percent of college graduates regret their major. God knows the number who regret their careers. That's not a failure of information. It's a failure of self-knowledge. And the fix isn't more data, more career fairs, or more optimization.

It's the oldest idea in education, finally taken seriously: know thyself. And someone willing to help you get there.
