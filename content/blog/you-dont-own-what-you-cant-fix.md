# You Don't Own What You Can't Fix

That $400 raw denim you've never washed. The $200 knife you only use to open Amazon packages. The Arc'teryx shell, still pristine after two years.

You're not buying quality. You're buying the *feeling* of being the kind of person who buys quality.

There's a difference.

I know because I've done it. Bought the "buy it for life" gear. Watched the heritage brand YouTube videos. Joined the subreddits. Talked about "patina development" like it was a spiritual practice.

Meanwhile, I couldn't change my own oil.

The gear was a costume. I was performing a character—*the competent man*—without doing the work to become him.

Heidegger had a term for this: *present-at-hand*. It's when a tool becomes an object of contemplation rather than an extension of your capability. You admire the hammer instead of driving the nail. You photograph the knife instead of using it.

The opposite is *ready-to-hand*: the tool disappears into use. You don't think about the wrench; you think about the bolt. The gear stops being a thing you *own* and becomes a thing you *wield*.

The EDC collector lives entirely in present-at-hand mode. The knife is rotated, photographed, discussed, but never absorbed into actual practice. It remains an object, not an instrument.

Here's the psychology underneath:

You work in abstraction. Emails, decks, Slack threads. You produce nothing tangible. At the end of the day, there's no object you made, no machine you fixed, nothing you can point to and say *I did that*.

This creates a specific anxiety. A suspicion that despite your income and your title, you couldn't survive a weekend without your laptop. Couldn't change a tire. Couldn't fix a leaky faucet. Couldn't make anything real.

The gear is a ward against that anxiety. You can't *be* capable, so you *buy* capable. The $800 jacket becomes a talisman. If I own what a competent man owns, maybe I am one.

**But it doesn't work.** You know it doesn't work. The anxiety stays because the incompetence stays.

Ask yourself this:

If your most expensive piece of gear broke tomorrow—really broke, not "send it back for warranty" broke—could you fix it?

Could you diagnose the problem? Source the parts? Do the repair yourself?

If the answer is no, you don't own it. You're renting it from the manufacturer until they decide it's not worth supporting anymore.

I rebuild motorcycles now. Old ones, temperamental ones. A Suzuki DR650 that's held together with J-B Weld and stubbornness.

Here's what I've learned: *ownership is maintenance*.

The bike breaks constantly. That's not a bug; it's a feature. Every breakdown is a lesson. Every repair is capability I didn't have before. I know why it runs rough at altitude. I can diagnose a misfire by sound. I've re-jetted the carb, rebuilt the clutch, replaced seals I didn't know existed six months ago.

The bike is ugly. It has scratches and duct tape and a cracked fairing. But it's *mine*. I've bled knuckles on it, misdiagnosed it, and often made it worse before I made it better. 

**That's ownership.** 

The guy with the showroom-clean bike isn't an owner. He's a custodian.

The Stoics understood this. Epictetus said the only things truly up to us are our own capacities - our judgment, our skills, our character. Everything else can be taken.

Your gear can be lost, stolen, broken, discontinued. *Your capability cannot.*

So why are you investing in the thing that can be taken instead of the thing that can't?

Here's the uncomfortable reframe:

You're not failing to develop real skills. You're *succeeding* at avoiding the discomfort of being a beginner.

Buying gear feels like progress. Feels like you're *becoming* the capable person. But it's actually a way to skip the part where you don't know what you're doing. The part where you break things. The part where you look stupid.

The fix isn't complicated. It's just uncomfortable.

Pick one machine. Car, motorcycle, bicycle; something with moving parts and the capacity to fail. Learn to maintain it yourself. Not "watch YouTube videos about maintaining it." Actually do it. Bleed the brakes. Change the oil. Adjust the valves.

You will screw it up. You will break something. You will feel stupid. This is the tax you pay to actually own what you own.

The alternative is to keep buying talismans. Keep performing competence. Keep feeling that low-grade anxiety every time someone asks if you can help them move something heavy.

Here's the image I want you to hold:

Two jackets.

The first is an $800 Arc'teryx. Gore-Tex Pro, fully taped seams, helmet-compatible hood. Pristine. Stored in a closet, waiting for an adventure that keeps getting postponed.

The second is a $50 Carhartt, fifteen years old. It's been patched three times; twice by hand, once by a tailor. The zipper has been replaced. There's a burn mark from a campfire and oil stains that won't come out.

Which one is worth more?

The Arc'teryx owner would say his. *He’s wrong.*

The Carhartt is *irreplaceable*. Not because you couldn't buy another one, but because the patches are earned. Each repair is evidence of use. Each stain is a story. The jacket has been *ready-to-hand*. It's disappeared into use; absorbed by work and weather and actual life.

The Arc'teryx is worth exactly what you paid for it. Nothing more.

You can keep buying the costume.

Or you can do the work to become the character.

Your call.
